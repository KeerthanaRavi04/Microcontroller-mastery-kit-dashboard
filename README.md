# Microcontroller-mastery-kit-dashboard
This project is a Microcontroller Mastery Kit Dashboard that displays real-time data from various sensors connected to a microcontroller. It helps students and enthusiasts learn how sensors work and interface with microcontrollers like Arduino, ESP32, or Raspberry Pi, visualizing data from sensors like DHT11, MQ-135, PIR, and BMP180.
